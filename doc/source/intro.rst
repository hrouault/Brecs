Introduction
============

*B-recs* is a powerful software for reconstructing dense localization
microscopy datasets.
Two options are offered to run *B-recs*.

Fiji plugin
-----------

A simple *Fiji / Image J* plugin allows the user to run *B-recs* in a
user-friendly environment. Datasets are loaded by *Fiji* itself and the
output is displayed as *Fiji* Images.

Command line tool
-----------------

A command line tool allows to streamline huge dataset analyses. This can be
used to run *B-recs* on a cluster for instance.

The most up to date version of *B-recs* can be found on a bitbucket page:
