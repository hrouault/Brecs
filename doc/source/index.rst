This document is meant to be the primary documentation source for the *B-recs*
project.

Introduction
------------

*B-recs* is a powerful software to reconstruct dense localization microscopy
datasets.
Two options are offered to run *B-recs*.

1. A simple Fiji plugin allows the user to run *B-recs* in a user-friendly
   environment. Dataset are loaded by Fiji itself and the output is displayed
   as Fiji Images.

2. A command line tool allows to streamline huge dataset analysis. This can be
   used to run *B-recs* on a cluster for instance.


Installation
------------

Again, two options are offered. One can first download a compiled version of
the Fiji plugin and try out *B-recs* in a minute. The second option is to
compile yourself *B-recs*. This is a more difficult task although scripts are
provided to ease the process. The major advantage of the second option is that
you can then run *B-recs* from the command line and the code is optimized for
your system: it allows optimal performances.
