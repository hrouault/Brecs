# Windows Port

## Dependencies

    -  Image libraries (CLI only)

        - If I can abstract, I can use WIC

    -  fftw binaries available as DLLs

        - Use of DLLs probably means CMake since it will simplify the 
          copy/install.  CMake should save some time over shell scripts.

          Note quite sure how to use the .DEFs; should be able to set link
          flags on the target at least.
          [ ] needed?
