[/] Image IO on windows

[ ] brecs_memalign and maybe the symmetric free
    [ ] revisit image decoder allocation in case this needs to use the
        brecs allocator/free. 
[x] replace command line parser/or delete the msvc cmdline.h or something

[ ] cplusplus header guards
[ ] document dependencies
[ ] check for avx vs sse2 and add to cflags

[ ] ? FFTW binaries seem to have SSE2.  Is it important for them to have AVX?
