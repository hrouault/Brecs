Windows Imaging Components (WIC)
--------------------------------

WIC provides an image i/o interface that is able to read/write a number of
useful formats including TIFFs.  

This functionality is exposed through a COM-interface. Older versions of 
windows should be able to simply install the WIC components by downloading 
them from Microsoft.
