Conditions of use
=================

These reference datasets are designed to be largely used by the developpers to
validate theirs software and by the users to check a software. They can be
freely used if the sources and references are properly cited.

Some of these datasets have been used for the ISBI 2013 Grand Challenge
organized in the conference IEEE ISBI 2013 at San Francisco to benchmark more
than 25 software.
